# The Travelling Salesman Problem  
### jmiu CS4306, Algorithm Analysis  
Uses Python 3.6  

# REPORT  
## Original Assignment  
Write a program that provides and approximate solution to the [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).  

## Solution  
The solution I came up with is, I believe, as its heart a greedy algorithm, despite that not being what I was actually trying to come up with.  
1. start at an initial city  
2. go to closest unvisited city  
3. determine if there is another city that can be visited  
4. if not, mark current path as impossible, and backtrack to previous city  
5. return path containing all cities, plus the origin at the end, for a total of n+1 cities

## Running  
Requires json to run  
Note: You can specify how the matrix is generated by inputting variables: `python tsp.py {matrix size} {max distance} {chance of adding connection (0 to 1)}` ex: `python tsp.py 100 100 0.5`  
or simply pass the filename of a matrix in json format: `python tsp.py matrix.json`
